                                    <p><b>Why is this being featured in Sampada?</b></p>
                                    <p>We wanted to share this news with our fellow alumni because this platform has
                                        been the brainchild of 3 graduates of UVCE— Lohith & Satish (2009 batch);
                                        Bhargav (2015 batch). They are the Founders of the company MetricDust, which is
                                        mainly into custom software and IT consultancy whose expertise includes building
                                        Web Applications; delivering AI/ML Projects; developing Blockchain applications
                                        etc.</p>
                                    <p>The organization believes in digital transformation with seamless user experience
                                        as the core of all the projects they undertake. Along with our founders, to
                                        support them in this endeavor are two more UVCE alumni as part of the
                                        team—Shahanwaz (2021), Ramya R (2023). Here is what they wanted to share with
                                        the fellow alumni : </p>
                                    <p>Lohith - “I have been a developer/creator/Inventor of new tech products all my
                                        life and I have developed at least 10 products from scratch. Thanks to UVCE, I
                                        got placed in IBM via campus placements in 2009. Since then, I have had the
                                        opportunity to work with renowned organizations and have multiple patents in my
                                        name. Around 2021, my friends & I started MetricDust and worked on couple of
                                        products. MetricRealties was one of the earliest SaaS products built by our team
                                        and we are super proud about this achievement. Long way to go...” </p>
                                    <p>Bhargav - “It has been a journey filled with lots of lessons and joy at the same
                                        time. While not working in MNC is a challenge, we are on a journey of our own.
                                        Every day presents us with new challenges, we are expected to wear different
                                        hats based on the dynamic needs & requirements. This has helped us to inculcate
                                        the entrepreneurial spirit amongst us, against all odds. We get to learn
                                        something new every day, which helps us discover new ways to meet end user
                                        expectations and create user-centric products.” </p>
                                    <p>Satish - “The idea is to understand how to unlearn & relearn simultaneously. The
                                        journey of startups is always uncertain, but with the team we have been able to
                                        build, has made me more comfortable and resilient, as you can always depend on
                                        them to support and even lead projects as and when required. Some of the readers
                                        would already know me as I am part of the Sampada team since the beginning. I
                                        was bit hesitant to be featured in it but did not want to miss talking about
                                        this milestone in our startup journey. I would like to request everyone from the
                                        alumni community to get in touch with us at MetricDust if you are looking for a
                                        technological solution in your endeavors. We'd love to collaborate with you.”

                                        Founders are further motivated to keep moving forward now that they have
                                        been recognized by their alma-mater. It is definitely a huge recognition to be
