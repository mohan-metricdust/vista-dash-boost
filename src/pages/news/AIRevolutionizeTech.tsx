                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    The global population shows no sign of stopping or slowing down and this intensifies the pressure on
                    farmers to produce more crops and level up their yield, this is further amplified with the
                    depreciating yield year on year due to poor soil health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's not all, look around – climate change further deepens these worries with unpredictable
                    weather patterns that lead to more arability and greater soil health degradation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditional farming methods which are largely based on hit & trial method can hardly keep up with
                    these demands. Reports by the Food and Agriculture Organization state that by 2050, we must produce
                    60 percent more food to feed a world population of 9.3 billion.{" "}

                    Contrarily studies also state that in 1970s 13 kg of foodgrain was produced per kg of fertilizer,
                    this was reduced to around 4kg of foodgrain/kg fertilizer

                    We are doomed if immediate measures are not taken to increase our yield without compromising on the
                    soil health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Soil health degradation & lower yield is not just a concern for the farmers but also a matter of
                    mass concern. Reduced harvests can lead to food shortages, price hikes, economic instability, and
                    increased social unrest. It might risk our sustenance and put our natural resources in a deeper
                    crisis.

                  <h3>Problems Faced by Farmers</h3>
                  <p>
                    Here are the major issues that we think foil the farmers the most in this tussle of maximizing yield
                    and maintaining soil health:
                  </p>
                  <b>1. Degrading Soil Health</b>
                  <p>Degrading soil health is a major barrier to maximizing crop yield.</p>
                  <p>
                    Continuous farming, overuse of chemical inputs, and poor land management strip soil of essential
                    nutrients and organic matter. This weakens soil structure, reduces water retention, and diminishes
                    microbial activity—critical for plant health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Market data available today suggests that there has been drastic decrease in the essential nutrients
                    in the soil like Nitrogen, Phosphorous, etc. The worsening pH level of the soil further leads to
                    increased root damage & fertilizer inefficiency.
                  </p>
                  <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

                  <p>
                    Without a healthy soil, plants struggle to access the nutrients and moisture they need, leading to
                    lower productivity. Restoring soil health through sustainable practices like crop rotation, organic
                    amendments, and reduced tillage is essential for long-term agricultural success and food security.

                  <br />
                  <b>2. Lack of Training & Insights</b>
                  <p>
                    We may idealize upcoming technologies and theories but are we touching grass and taking a stock of
                    the reality that the farmers face?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the rising importance of modern agricultural practices, especially in precision soil
                    management, there's a significant gap in how farmers are trained and informed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Studies by ITU suggest that about 60% of rural areas in developing countries lack reliable internet
                    access (International Telecommunication Union) This limits access to weather forecasts, market
                    prices, and Agri-advisory services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are few, if any, accessible institutions offering consistent, practical training on soil
                    health or the technologies available to monitor and improve it. This leaves farmers—especially
                    smallholders—relying on trial-and-error methods, risking both their yield and long-term land
                    productivity.
                  </p>

                  <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "small" }}>Source: insightsonindia.com</p>
                  <br />
                  <b>3. No Consistent Advisory Source</b>
                  <p>
                    While government bodies, NGOs, and retailers occasionally offer support, there is no single trusted,
                    consistent advisory source or repository of knowledge they can rely on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This disconnect also affects trust. Farmers often feel left behind by systems that don't prioritize
                    hands-on training, contextual advice, or follow-up resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, innovations in soil health management—like sensor-based nutrient tracking, satellite
                    data for soil moisture, or AI-based recommendations—remain out of reach for many who could benefit
                    the most.
                  </p>

                    Lack of institutions training farmer about modern agriculture practice and the incorporation of
                    technology with regarding to soil health management.

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>
                    Sustainable farming is no longer just an ideal—it's a necessity. With soil health at the core of
                    agricultural success, the integration of Agritech and AI offers a practical path forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Inconsistent and redundant farming techniques have not just increased soil acidity but have also
                    contributed to decreasing fertilizer efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From precision farming to AI-powered insights, these technologies help farmers boost yield while
                    preserving the integrity of their land. However, to fully realize this potential, consistent
                    training, accessible information, and trust-building institutions are essential.
