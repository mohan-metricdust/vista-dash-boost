                                        and set into action a process to implement and revert these obsolete systems
                                        that slow down & hinder business growth. We keep guessing how AI will or won’t

                                    <p>Intelligent automation or IA helps enterprises gain a competitive and lasting
                                        edge over their competitors in the market. This is especially true for
                                        medium-sized organizations to streamline their operations and scale their
                                        business. Below we’ve discussed the three pillars of Intelligent automation.</p>
                                    <h4>1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):</h4>
                                    <p>AI is perhaps the most crucial among all the three components of Intelligent
                                        Automation. The cognitive abilities of AI models emulate human intelligence that
                                        analyzes, and segregates structured and unstructured data using Machine learning
                                        and other complex algorithms. According to IBM, this helps enterprises develop a
                                        knowledge base and formulate further predictions. IBM terms AI to be “the
                                        decision engine of IA.”</p>

                                    <h4>2. Business Process Management (BPM):</h4>
                                    <p>Business process management is also called business workflow automation. It is
                                        the set of technologies that streamline and automate workflows for improved
                                        agility and better consistency for a chosen business. BPM is employed across
                                        domains to improve interactions and engagement.</p>
                                    <img src="../images/news/aiAuto-5.jpg" className="img-fluid rounded-30 " />
                                    <h4>3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA):</h4>
                                    <p>Robotic process automation uses software bots to complete back-office tasks like
                                        data extraction or automatically filling forms. These robots fit well by the
                                        insights provided with AI to increase the use cases of automation and undertake
                                        even more complex tasks.</p>
